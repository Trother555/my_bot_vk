# my_bot_vk
A simple bot for VK based on node.js vk-chat-bot module. Commands:

/raise - generates a random positive number (amount of 'bablo') and adds it to user's account stored in mongodb.
/load - return total amount of 'bablo' accumulated with /raise command and sets it to 0.
/bablo - shows total amount of 'bablo' accumulated
/help - returns help

This is sort of a parody on the notorious online casino.
